Some thoughts on design...

Game implementation is very basic.
I hard coded a small list of words, this could be expanded or use a remote dictionary of some kind in the future, but to keep it simple I chose a few words, with no repeated letters.
I also incorporated a cron job to send emails to users who have registered but have no logged any wins yet.
I did this to encourage payers to play the game and move up the rankings.
