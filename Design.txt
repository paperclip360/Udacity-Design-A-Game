Some thoughts on design...

Game implementation is very basic.

I hard coded a small list of words which could be expanded or use a remote dictionary of some kind in the future. 
To keep it simple I chose a few words, with no repeated letters, as repeated letters would require a bit more logic code to handle.

I also incorporated a cron job to send emails to users who have registered but have no logged any wins yet.
I did this to encourage payers to play the game and move up the rankings. 

Also, for simplicity I did not require authentication for users, simply required the user to register their name before playing. 
This could also be improved for future design.
